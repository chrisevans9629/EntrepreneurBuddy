# EntrepreneurChute
entrepreneurchute is the latest and greatest technology 
to connect aspiring entrepreneurs and experienced mentors. 

Entrepreneurs with specific issues or questions can use this to connect
them with one of our expert mentors that have the skills they are looking for.

Entrepreneurs also have the opportunity to connect with other businesspeople that 
share the same goals. 

Mentors can collaborate with entrepreneurs to gain a fresh perspective and 
new ideas. They can also discover startup businesses to partner with.

This is also a way for established
individuals to give back to the business community by fostering entrepreneurship.
